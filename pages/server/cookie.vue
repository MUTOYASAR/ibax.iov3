    <h6 class="title-h6">What are cookies ?</h6>
    <p>
      Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile
      device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners
      in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well
      as to provide reporting information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cookies set by the website owner (in this case,<strong
        >IBAX NETWORK Ltd </strong
      >) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the
      website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable
      third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the
      website (e.g. like advertising, interactive content and analytics). The
      parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer
      both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits
      certain other websites.
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">Why do we use cookies ?</h6>
    <p>
      We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies
      are required for technical reasons in order for our Websites to operate,
      and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
      Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our
      users to enhance the experience on our Online Properties.Third parties
      serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other
      purposes.This is described in more detail below.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our
      Websites and the purposes they perform are described below (please note
      that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Online
      Properties you visit):
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">How can I control cookies ?</h6>
    <p>
      You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can
      exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie
      Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which
      categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be
      rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and on
      our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our
      website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website
      may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to
      accept or refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies
      through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should
      visit your browser's help menu for more information.
    </p>

      targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information,

      What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons ?
    </h6>
    <p>
      Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website.
      We may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons
      (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny
      graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to
      recognize when someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail
      including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor the traffic
      patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or
      communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to the
      website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website,
      to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail
      marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on
      cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their
      functioning.
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h6>
    <p>
      Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local
      Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store
      information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other
      site operations.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust
      the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the
      tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also
      control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and
      following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain,
      for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to
      "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
      being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash
      Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being
      delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance
      of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash
      applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
      connection with our services or online content.
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">Do you serve targeted advertising ?</h6>
    <p>
      Third parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve
      advertising through our Websites. These companies may use information
      about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide relevant
      advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in.
      They may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness
      of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web
      beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites
      in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of
      potential interest to you. The information collected through this process
      does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
      details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
    </p>
    <h6 class="title-h6">How often will you update this Cookie Policy ?</h6>
    <p>
      We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to reflect,
      for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal
      or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Policy
      regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related
      technologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The date at the top of this Cookie Policy indicates when it was last
      updated.
